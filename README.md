# 📱 Mindful Watching Without Killing Engagement

A UI/UX redesign concept for YouTube’s mobile viewing experience, developed for **Design Forge 2025**. This project focuses on encouraging **mindful content consumption** without harming user **engagement or retention**—using only interface-level changes (no backend logic involved).

---

## 🧠 Project Concept

Redesign YouTube's mobile app to gently **discourage compulsive binge-watching**. The goal is to maintain the dopamine-driven flow of videos, while helping users be more aware of their watch time through smart, subtle UX elements.

### 🎯 Focus Areas
- 🎛 **Micro-interactions** that promote short breaks  
- 🌈 **Visual rhythm cues** that evolve with viewing patterns  
- 🕒 **Non-intrusive session/time reminders**  
- 🌀 **Subconscious nudges** integrated into layout
